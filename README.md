# The Wiley Real Estate Group Webpage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Story

TWREG, Inc. is a private commercial real-estate company that specializes in broker advisory, and multifamily investment opportunities. Previously the website was managed with Adobe Muse, however once the company wanted to take advantage of Buildout's plugins, the site had to be revamped by code-oriented frameworks. Thus, I developed the frontend by using ReactJS along with bootstrap, which now allows buildout to manage the backend.
